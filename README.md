# Diamonds

In this project, I focused on learning some of the basic fundamentals of Objective-C. As someone who is more familiar and experienced with Swift, I believe learning SOME components of Objective-C is still vital for larger, older apps such as Instagram. Most of these apps -- while may include code structure around Swift -- still have some lifecycle around Objective-C. This application is based off the very infamous $1,000 app called "I am rich," by displaying assets from a iOS Development couse I participated in within a UITableView.

# What I learned
- Understanding the syntax difference between Objective-C and Swift.
- Using Interface Builder (Storyboards) within a Objective-C based applicaiton.
- Introduction of header and main file types.
- Considering limited skill-set in Objective-C, using what knowledge I understand now to allow my application to successfully work.

# Problems I'd face
- Exposing myself outside of Swift led to many syntax difficulties.
